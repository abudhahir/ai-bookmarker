# AI Bookmarker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-Powered Summarization
The core feature is using AI, powered by the `langchain-js` framework, to automatically summarize bookmarked web pages and content. All summaries must be stored alongside the original bookmark.

### II. Chrome Extension First
The primary user interface is a browser extension for Google Chrome, enabling seamless, one-click bookmarking and interaction.

### III. Cloud Sync & Backup
All bookmarks, summaries, and user data are securely synchronized to a cloud backend. This ensures data is backed up and accessible across devices where the user is logged in.

### IV. Robust Tagging and Search
Every bookmark must be classifiable with user-defined tags. All content, including the original bookmarked content and the AI-generated summary, must be indexed for full-text search.

### V. User Data Privacy
All user data, bookmarked content, and summaries are considered private and confidential. The system MUST NOT share or analyze user data for purposes other than providing direct service to the user. All data processing must comply with strict privacy standards.

## Technology Stack

The project will adhere to the following technology stack:
- **AI Framework**: `langchain-js`
- **Frontend**: Google Chrome Extension APIs

## Development Workflow

All new features must include corresponding tests. Code reviews are required for all pull requests to ensure adherence to the constitution and coding standards.

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and a migration plan for existing features if applicable. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
